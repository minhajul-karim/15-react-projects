# Cart

A shopping cart.

## Usage

This app loads data from an external API. The counter in the header represents the number of products in the cart. The total price is displayed at the bottom of the page that updates in real-time. Use the `up-arrow` to increment and the `down-arrow` to decrement the number of amount in the cart. Decrementing the amount to zero removes the item from the cart. Good luck!
